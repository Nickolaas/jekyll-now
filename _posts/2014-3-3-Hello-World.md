I think it's really cool that we're using learning algorithms to do things like detecting sickle cells present in blood. There are so many problems in computational biology that can be solved with (unsupervised) learning, and there are more efficient algorithms developed by the open source community and research scientists everyday. Then there's also deep learning, which is the most fascinating subset of machine learning (imo), e.g. Standfords autonomous helicopter, and that's hardly scratching the surface when it comes to modeling more abstract data.
