I feel really awful for one of my closest friends, James. A couple of years ago, on new years eve (lots of shots), there was an incident where he left his mic unattended and.. unmuted. This, at first didn't strike anybody as a big deal, but, what happened afterward, indeed turn out to be... a big deal.

James was hanging out with the fam-bam, namely Auntie Barbara, when things got a little.. wild you could say. Some of the things that were heard via his microphone that night are as follows: 

James: SO MANY SHOTS ON NEW YEARS (repeatedly)
James: THAT FEELS S-
James: THAT FEELS SO

*rumbles to get his microphone muted, presumably once he'd realized he'd just gotten a blowjob from his auntie live on Skype*

*mute*

Now he's denying it and I don't know how to aid him if he's unwilling to accept the reality of it. Any tips, guys?
